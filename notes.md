## Theory of PSO

Parsopoulos and Vrahatis (2001) studied the behavior of the PSO when Gaussian distributed random noise was added to the fitness function and random rotations of the search
space were performed. Experimental results indicated that the PSO remained effective in
the presence of noise, and, in some cases, noise even helped the PSO avoid being trapped in
local optima
